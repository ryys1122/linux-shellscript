How to install the PBS accounting tools:
----------------------------------------

1. Check (and reconfigure) the location of system files:

   TORQUEHOME=/var/spool/torque (in pbsjobs, pbsnodect and pbsreportmonth)
   BINDIR=/usr/local/bin (in pbsacct, pbsnodect and pbsreportmonth)


2. Copy the files pbs* and mm2month to $BINDIR:

   cp pbs* mm2month /usr/local/bin/


3. Ensure that you have read-access to the accounting files.
You may need to be root for this, or you may want to relax
the permissions on $PBSHOME/server_priv so that ordinary
users may read the accounting directory.  For example:

   chmod 751 $TORQUEHOME/server_priv
   chmod 755 $TORQUEHOME/server_priv/accounting

may allow read-access for all users.  Ensure that the
server's accounting files are readable, too (seems to
be the default with PBS v2.2).


4. Test that pbsacct works correctly:
   cd <Report-directory>
   pbsacct <accounting-files>


5. The script "pbsreportmonth" is a convenient way to automatically
generate a monthly report for the previous month. Edit the E-mail
addresses in the script:

# People who will receive the report
SUBSCRIBERS="user1 user2..."

It may be run on the first day of every month using crontab with
a line like this:

0 2 1 * * (cd <Report-directory>; /usr/local/bin/pbsreportmonth)
