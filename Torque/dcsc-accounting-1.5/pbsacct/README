PBS/Torque daily accounting scripts
===================================

The key tool is the script "pbsacctdcsc" which generates accounting data 
in a format defined by DCSC, and which must be used as input for graphical
presentations.

Some path locations of files are configurable in the scripts, but the scripts
have been configured with /var/spool/dcsc as the top-level directory where we
keep databases, configurations etc.

pbsacctdcsc script
------------------

Extracts Torque accounting data for a single day (corresponding to the Torque
raw accounting file such as 20090120) and dumps it into a DCSC accounting database
file such as 20090120.db located in /var/spool/dcsc/accounting.

This DCSC accounting database file must be used as input for graphics tools
displaying usage statistics.

The output format is (colon separated):
DCSC-center Installation-name Username Group Walltime(core-days) Today(epoch) Group-cores-DCSC Group-cores-local

pbsjobs script
--------------

Raw Torque accounting data (located in /var/spool/torque/server_priv/accounting/)
are processed by the "pbsjobs" script, which is part of Ole Holm Nielsen's
simple Torque/PBS accounting package "pbsacct" available from 
ftp://ftp.fysik.dtu.dk/pub/Torque/ .  Please obtain the latest "pbsjobs" script
from that package.
