Version 1.5
-----------
pbsacctdcsc: Added output for ALL grant groups, even if usage==0.  This is needed
       for graphs of DCSC/Local cores to be continuous.

Version 1.3
-----------
pbsacctdcsc: Added check for missing UNIX group (assign to group NOGROUP)
pbsacctdcsc.load: New script to create database records from old Torque 
       accounting files.
All scripts: Changed /bin/sh to /bin/bash for compatibility with UNIX systems

Version 1.2
-----------
pbsjobs: Incorrect processing of the Torque nodes file fixed.

Version 1.1
-----------
pbsacctdcsc: Added check of midnight timestamp.
       Added MAUI_NODEACCESSPOLICY flags to call pbsjobs with Single node 
       accounting.
       Sanity check of MAUI_NODEACCESSPOLICY against current MAUI config.
pbsacctdcsc.cron2: New script to be run from cron AFTER midnight
       so that we avoid the "sleep" in pbsacctdcsc.cron.
       The INSTALL documentation was updated accordingly.
pbsjobs: Introduced an optional argument -S (for "Single").
       This should be used if you use the MAUI scheduler's single
       job/task/user per node features SINGLEUSER/SINGLEJOB/SINGLETASK,
       http://www.clusterresources.com/products/maui/docs/5.3nodeaccess.shtml.
       In this case a job is charged for the use of an ENTIRE NODE in stead of
       the default, which is the actual number of processors used within each
       node. Requested by Niels Carl Hansen.
       We get the node's #CPU cores from the Torque "nodes" file.
       One caveat is required: If the system was changed after the accounting
       record was made, a nodename may have disappeared from the "nodes"
       file, and hence we have lost all memory of this node's #CPU cores.
       In this case we only account for the actual #CPU cores used.
       Therefore the accounting script should NOT be rerun after changes have
       been made to the nodes in the system, or inaccuracies will occur !
