Install rrdtool
===============

First install the rrdtool software, the homepage is at
http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/.  We have tested this software
at rrdtool version 1.2.29.

On RPM and YUM based systems (such as RedHat5/CentOS5) you can do:
   yum install rrdtool
or get the RPM packages from the http://rpmforge.net directory
http://packages.sw.be/rrdtool/.  For RHEL4 you need the 
packages rrdtool and perl-rrdtool (and perhaps also perl-Time-HiRes).

On Debian systems: (Torben ?)
On SUN Solaris systems: (Boyan Lazarov ?)
