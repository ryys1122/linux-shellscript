Installation
============

Prerequisites for non-Linux installations (AIX etc.):
BASH 3.2.33 has been tested to work with our scripts.
GNU awk (gawk) is required (path to gawk is configured in the "config" file).

Install the RRDTOOL software, see instructions in dailygraphs/INSTALL.

Basic installation steps
------------------------

1. Edit these files for your local system: config site unixgroups grants.
If you want to account for entire nodes (in stead of CPU cores used),
edit the "config" file so that MAUI_NODEACCESSPOLICY is the same as your 
MAUI configuration (pbsacctdcsc will check for consistency).

2. Install files and scripts using this script:
   ./install.sh

Group accounting installation steps
-----------------------------------

3. Create RRDTOOL databases for group accounting:
   # rrdcreategroupall

4. Create database records for old Torque accounting files:
   # pbsacctdcsc.load
This can take several minutes.
To initialize the RRD databases, load the old accounting database records:
   # rrdloadold

5. Run the daily RRD database update script once as a test:
   # /usr/local/bin/pbsacctdcsc.cron2
and then make a daily crontab job right AFTER midnight (for the previous day):
   15 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/pbsacctdcsc.cron2

6. Create group statistics graphs:
   # rrdgraphgroupall
and then make a daily crontab job after the above crontab job:
   20 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/rrdupdategroup.cron
The graph files will be created in the WWWDIR (see the "config" file).

System accounting installation steps
------------------------------------

7. Create RRDTOOL database for system accounting:
   # rrdcreatesystem
Create RRDTOOL database for DCSC grants:
   # rrdcreategrants

8. Edit the load data update script "rrdupdatesystem":
If your batch system uses the MAUI/Moab scheduler, we supply lines for the
MAUI scheduler using the "showq" command to extract system load data. 
Similar script lines are currently needed for the IBM LoadLeveler and the
SUN Grid Engine (please send your contribution back to Ole.H.Nielsen@fysik.dtu.dk).

9. Run the load data update script:
   # rrdupdatesystem
Update the system load statistics and graphs every 5 minutes from "cron":
   */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/rrdupdatesystem.cron
Also update the DCSC grants RRD database on a daily basis from "cron":
   10 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/rrdupdategrants.cron
The graph files will be created in the WWWDIR (see the "config" file).

WWW-server installation steps
-----------------------------

10. Now that statistics and graphing works correctly, you may want to 
change WWWDIR in the "config" file so that it points to a place on
your web server where the data can be presented to the Internet.

11. Decide which WWW-server you want to use to display the installation graphs.
Make sure that the above mentioned WWWDIR is available on the WWW-server, for
example by NFS-mounting or by remote copying:
   # rsync -av --delete $WWWDIR/ remoteserver:/some/dir/WWW/

12. In the subdirectory WWW we have collected some scripts that have been
tested with an Apache WWW-server.  The directory index file "index.pl" 
is used to generate HTML-pages using a Perl CGI method.  You must configure
your Apache server to allow generation of Perl CGI pages, please see the
example file "httpd.conf".  The file ".htaccess" must be copied to the WWWDIR.
